# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect breast cancer using mammogram data by applying various machine learning algorithms including **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **XGBoost**, and **Random Forest**. A user-friendly **Tkinter-based GUI** is provided for easy interaction with the system.

## 📌 Project Overview

Early detection of breast cancer significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project leverages machine learning to classify mammogram data into benign or malignant cases, providing a tool that can assist in preliminary diagnosis.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

Each model was trained and evaluated to compare accuracy, precision, and recall, allowing selection of the best-performing algorithm.

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Source**: Mammogram dataset (e.g., [CBIS-DDSM](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) or similar)
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature scaling
  - Label encoding
  - Train-test split

---

## 🧪 Features

- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand data distribution
- Feature scaling for optimized model performance
- Comparative analysis of multiple classifiers
- **Tkinter GUI** for real-time prediction input and output
